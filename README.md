This is a little 'flake/devshell powered' tool helps you to do a couple of things:
- [Fetch different kernel configs ](https://github.com/gytis-ivaskevicius/linux-kernel-comparison/blob/master/flake.nix#L27-L32)
- [Normalize/Cleanup/Deduplicate fetched configs](https://github.com/gytis-ivaskevicius/linux-kernel-comparison/blob/master/flake.nix#L35-L50)
- [Shows the differences between fetched configs](https://github.com/gytis-ivaskevicius/linux-kernel-comparison/blob/master/flake.nix#L55-L64)
- [Also it shows you documentation of the option that you are currently comparing (powered by terminal browser lynx :D)](https://github.com/gytis-ivaskevicius/linux-kernel-comparison/blob/master/flake.nix#L58-L60)

At some point, I was going to investigate what's going on with the NixOS kernel but never ended up finishing this adventure
